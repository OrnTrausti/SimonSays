(5) didn't make a drawing?
<br>
why I failed
<br>
I failed because I let the stress overtake me I am sensitive to loud noise and it can get me stressed when I was striping wires I crushed it too far and the wires kept breaking when I moved the box I also believe I not just restarted was one of my downfalls I kept trying to fix the wires and striping it more and more which just let it be too short so they kept braking more but before I put it in the box I did finish if you see my 2 images they both were taking when the box fully worked but at the end, I failed
